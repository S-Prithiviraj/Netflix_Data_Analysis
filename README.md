Welcome to my data analysis project! As a passionate data analyst, I've delved into the Netflix dataset using Python to uncover insights and trends. This project aims to analyze the dataset to identify key factors influencing viewership, content popularity, and subscription trends. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations. The repository contains all the code, analysis, and visualizations needed. You can clone the repository, install the required libraries using pip, and run the Jupyter notebook to see the data analysis process. The project reveals several key insights, which are visualized in the notebook and detailed in the corresponding sections. I welcome contributions to improve this project. If you have suggestions or find any issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request. This project is licensed under the MIT License. Happy analyzing! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ“Š
